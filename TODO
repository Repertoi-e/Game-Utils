Threads and TLS doesn't work with LSTD_NO_CRT 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following things implemented in windows but not on posix yet:
  LSTD:
- os wallclock functions
- changes in console_reader/writer that remove virtual functions
- threads
  LE:
- game loop and windows and events 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Way to get monitor refresh rate (and possibly other system info)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Replace LE's game loop with a platform inspecific one
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Allow users to add more variables to Implicit_Context (do this with headers)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At the moment every allocation has a 24 byte header (the Allocator it used and the size of the allocation)
This is done to make sure delete always uses the right allocator as well as provide convenience for the user.
(Calling delete no matter the context uses the right allocator etc...)

Maybe those 24 don't matter in today's world where computers have practically infinite RAM,
but it feels like it's too wasteful.

Rewrite vendor libraries and reduce to the minimum needed
