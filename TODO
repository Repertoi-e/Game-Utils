- Add "has" functions to containers to allow for more expressive python-like syntax
	(e.g. if (str.has('C')) {...})
- Unify APIs for containers (naming and usage is very inconsistent atm)
- Write iterators for all containers

- Re-do test framework assert functionality 

- Parsing from strings to types
- Write more fmt tests
- Console colors and text formatting utilites 

- File system permissions, copy, move, create links

- Support for threads

- Support ability to compile without CRT (it will be very hard to support this as a simple switch, but not impossible!)
