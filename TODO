- Support ability to compile without CRT (it will be very hard to support this as a simple switch, but not impossible!)
----------------
Currently there is no way to pass constructor arguments to New<My_Type>(allocator...)
Only now I realize it's a problem since most of the stuff in our library/engine has a parameterless default constructor,
but users may want to have things like that. The current workout is to provide an empty default constructor and use placement new:

	auto *myType = new(New<My_Type>()) My_Type(...params...);
----------------
Remove all instances of "virtual" in our code.
This will help with the ability to compile without CRT
----------------
The following things implemented in windows but not on posix yet:
  LSTD:
- os wallclock functions
- changes in console_reader/writer that remove virtual functions
  LE:
- game loop and windows and events
