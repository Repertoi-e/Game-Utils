- File system permissions, copy, move, create links
- Remove append_cstring*/append_string functions (in string and String_Builder)
    in favor of a general append function (because it's proven to be more annoying than anything else)

- Move non-template functions' implementation to .cpp files to reduce redundant compiling on the user's side

- THREAD LOCAL STORAGE FOR THE CONTEXT
- Which reminds me.. We should do threads

- More string stuff
    Extend the string class and add utility functions
    Parsing from strings to types
    Make parameters in to_string functions less cryptic

- Go to windows and implement everything platform specific there
