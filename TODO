The following things implemented in windows but not on posix yet:
  LSTD:
- os wallclock functions
- changes in console_reader/writer that remove virtual functions
  LE:

At the moment every allocation has a 24 byte header (the Allocator it used and the size of the allocation)
This is done to make sure delete always uses the right allocator as well as provide convenience for the user.
(Calling delete no matter the context uses the right allocator etc...)

Maybe those 24 don't matter in today's world where computers have practically infinite RAM,
but it feels like it's too wasteful.
