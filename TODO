- Use sconstruct for a build system, because I like it and it's getting pretty cumbersome with just a build.sh
- Write more tests for basic functionality so that in case something breaks we know right away...
- THREAD LOCAL STORAGE FOR THE CONTEXT
- Which reminds me.. We should do threads
- More string stuff (parsing from string to types)

- File stuff
- Go to windows and implement everything platform specific there
