- Parsing from strings to types

- Console colors and text formatting utilites 

- File system permissions, copy, move, create links

- Support for threads

- Support ability to compile without CRT (it will be very hard to support this as a simple switch, but not impossible!)

- assert_eq((char32_t) a.get(0), 'a');
	should be just
  assert_eq(a.get(0), 'a');
	but we get a weird type error...
